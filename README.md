# STILLALI

I wanted to "challenge" myself to see what I could create in 3 days with a language I had zero experience with (so this is my first QBASIC program). I learned new stuff as I went along, so the code is pretty sloppy. The problem is that the delays between notes had to be different, so there was not a very neat way to lay it out.


What it was designed for:
- Intel 8088 (An NEC V20 should work as well of course, and it will run on anything faster)
- Amber Phosphor Monochrome CRT (or CRT that has an amber monochrome text mode like the NEC MultiSync II)
